\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Defines the methods and the data fields of the inventory. 

The class stores four static maps that model Geralt’s inventory, bestiary and trophies, and offers high-\/level actions that correspond to the grammar rules.

Every method accepts a tokenized command line and either mutates the shared state or prints the answer required by the specification.
